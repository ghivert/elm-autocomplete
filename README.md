# Autocomplete

This package provides a full, working autocomplete in elm, able to do AJAX requests and searching in local data. Foundations are coming from [elm-athlete/formbuilder-autocomplete](https://github.com/elm-athlete/formbuilder-autocomplete), my previous work with [elm-athlete/athlete](https://github.com/elm-athlete/athlete), formerly know as `elm-bodybuilder/elegant`.
